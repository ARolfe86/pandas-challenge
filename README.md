# School Data Analysis

Most successful students come from medium sized schools having between 1,000 to 
2,000 students. The medium sized schools had an overall passing rate of 90%, where as a large size school of 2,000 to 5,000 students had an overall passing rate of 58%. The small size school of < 1,000 students had an overall passing rate of 89%. The data also shows that students attending a Charter school have better overall passing rates than students attending a District school. The overall passing rate for Charter schools was 90% where the overall passing rate for District schools was only 53%. Overall the trend shows test scores drop as the spending range per student increases. The highest overall passing rate was 90% from the spending range of < $585 per student and the lowest overall passing rate was 53% from the spending range of $645-680 per student.
